## Flask Application Design for Building an App Showing Recent News Articles

### HTML Files

- **index.html (Home Page)**
   - Contains the main interface of the application, typically including a header with a title and navigation bar, and a main section for displaying news articles.
   - Can utilize Bootstrap or other HTML/CSS frameworks for styling and responsiveness.

### Routes

- **index**
   - Root route, mapped to the `index.html` file, serves the main interface of the application.
- **news_articles**
   - Endpoint to fetch recent news articles from a data source (e.g., News API, RSS feeds).
   - Typically uses a GET request and returns a JSON response containing the news articles.
- **search_articles**
   - Endpoint to handle search requests for specific news articles based on keywords or other criteria.
   - Similar to `news_articles`, this route takes input parameters, performs a search, and returns the results as a JSON response.

### Implementation Details

- The `news_articles` route can use a Python library like the News API Python library to fetch articles based on predefined categories or keywords.
- The `search_articles` route can take search keywords as input and use them to query the news source for relevant articles.
- The JSON responses from both routes can be handled by a JavaScript function, which can then update the UI to display the news articles to the user.

### Additional Considerations

- The application can be further enhanced by including pagination, filters, user authentication, and other features to improve user experience and functionality.
- For production deployment, consider using a web server such as Nginx or Gunicorn as a reverse proxy to handle requests.
